## üéØ The Problem

Street food vendors are the heart of India's culinary culture, yet they operate on thin margins and face daily operational hurdles. Sourcing raw materials is often inefficient, forcing them to deal with price volatility, inconsistent quality, and the logistical nightmare of visiting crowded wholesale markets. This eats into their valuable time and hard-earned profits.

## üí° Our Solution

**SwaadBazaar** is a mobile-first web platform designed to be the ultimate digital assistant for every street food vendor. We digitize the supply chain, creating a transparent and efficient ecosystem that directly benefits the vendor.

* **üí∞ Cost Savings:** By enabling hyperlocal group buying, we give individual vendors the collective bargaining power of a supermarket, unlocking access to wholesale prices.
* **‚è∞ Time Efficiency:** No more morning trips to the market. Vendors can order everything they need in minutes from their phone, freeing up time to focus on what they do best: cooking and serving customers.
* **üóëÔ∏è Reduced Waste:** Our AI-powered forecasting engine analyzes past sales and local trends to predict demand, ensuring vendors buy only what they need, minimizing spoilage and maximizing profit.
* **‚úÖ Quality Assurance:** A community-driven trust and rating system helps vendors identify and build relationships with the most reliable, high-quality suppliers in their area.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* üë• **Dual-Role Portals:** Seamless interfaces for both Vendors (to order and track) and Suppliers (to manage inventory and sales).
* üì¶ **Hyperlocal Group Buying:** Allows multiple vendors in a locality to combine their orders for items like onions or cooking oil into a single large purchase, automatically unlocking bulk discounts.
* üß† **AI Demand Forecasting:** A dedicated microservice predicts a vendor's weekly raw material needs. It considers past sales data, day of the week, seasonality, and even local holidays to provide actionable insights.
* üó∫Ô∏è **Smart Supplier Matchmaking:** Connects vendors to the nearest, highest-rated suppliers based on their live location and the specific items they need, ensuring fresh produce and fast delivery.
* ‚≠ê **Trust & Rating System:** After each transaction, vendors can rate suppliers on quality, timeliness, and price. This builds a transparent and self-regulating marketplace.
* üîî **Real-Time Notifications:** Instant SMS and WhatsApp alerts for order confirmations, when a group buy target is met, and delivery status updates.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Admin Dashboard:** An internal panel for the SwaadBazaar team to onboard and verify suppliers (KYC), resolve disputes, and monitor platform health.

## ü§î Why This Tech Stack?

Our technology choices were guided by the need for rapid development, scalability, and performance‚Äîcritical for a hackathon.

* **Next.js (Frontend):** Provides server-side rendering for a fast initial page load and SEO benefits, crucial for a public-facing platform. Its file-based routing and component model accelerate development.
* **Node.js & Express (Backend):** The robust, event-driven architecture of Node.js is perfect for handling numerous concurrent API requests. The vast NPM ecosystem allows for quick integration of essential services.
* **FastAPI (AI Microservice):** For our AI model, FastAPI offers blazing-fast performance (on par with Node.js) and automatically generated, interactive API documentation, which is perfect for integrating ML services.
* **Supabase (BaaS):** A fantastic all-in-one solution. It provides a managed PostgreSQL database, instant APIs, user authentication, and file storage out of the box. This drastically reduces backend setup time and complexity.
* **Vercel & Render (Hosting):** These platforms offer seamless, Git-based deployment workflows, allowing us to push code and see it live in minutes without worrying about complex server configuration.
